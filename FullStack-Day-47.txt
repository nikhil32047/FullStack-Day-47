Assertion in Python
========================
An assertion is a debugging aid used to test conditions during program execution.
If the condition is True, the program continues.
If False, Python raises an AssertionError.

Syntax:
assert condition, "error message"


a) Simple Assertion
============================
A simple assertion checks a condition without a custom message.

Example:
x = 10
assert x > 0
print("x is positive")


If the condition fails:

assert x < 0   # AssertionError

Key Points:
Used for internal checks
Helps catch logical errors early


b) Augmented Assertion
=============================
An augmented assertion includes a custom error message for better debugging.

Example:
age = 15
assert age >= 18, "Age must be 18 or above"

Key Points:
Provides meaningful error messages
Improves readability and debugging
Can be disabled using -O optimization flag
